# Programming for Data Analytics 

Author: Irene Kilgannon

Student ID: G00220627

This is my repository for the module, Programming for Data Analytics for a [Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) at [Atlantic Technological University](https://www.atu.ie/).

The repository contains three directories:

    * PFDA-mywork
    * PFDA-assignments
    * PFDA-project

## PFDA-mywork

This PFDA-mywork directory contains the lab work that is associated with the weekly lectures.

## PFDA-assignments

The assignments directory will contain a mixture of small practical assignments and a mini project.

Five assignments were set. These assignments were:

- Assignment 1
    - Create a repository for the module. 
    - [My repository](https://github.com/IreneKilgannon/PFDA)

- assignment2-weather.ipynb
    - Using a csv file in the assignment folder in the [PFDA-courseware repository]((https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware)) create a nice plot of the temperature over time.
    - Use the 'dryBulbTemperature_Celsius' column

- assignment03-pie.ipynb
    - A nice pie chart of peoples email domains in the csv file at the [url](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download).

- assignment_5_risk.py
    - The program that simulates 1000 individual battle rounds in Risk (3 attacker vs 2 defender) and plots the result.
    - For extra marks: a more complicated version that simulates a full series of rounds for armies of arbitrary sizes, until one side is wiped out and plots the results.

- assignment_6_Weather.ipynb
    - Using the data from this link, https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv
    - Plot:
        * The temperature
        * The mean temperature each day
        * The mean temperature for each month
        * The Wind speed
        * The rolling windspeed (say over 24 hours)
        * The max windspeed for each day
        * The monthly mean of the daily max wind speeds

## PFDA-project

The project directory will contain a large project.

## Installation

To run the file on your local system, the following must be downloaded and installed.

1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Anaconda is a Python distribution and comes with pre-installed packages. Please note that when installing Anaconda it is important to check the two boxes for:
  * Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable.
  * Register Anaconda3 as my default.

2. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

4. Install [Cmder](https://cmder.app/)

5. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com). 

## Usage

With Cmder (or the terminal of Visual Studio Code) enter the following to clone the repository from GitHub onto your own machine:
  
    ``git clone https://github.com/IreneKilgannon/PFDA.git``

Used codespaces as my machine struggled with the large files of the project. 

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) uses Visual Studio Code in a Linux environment, the command line (terminal) of Visual Studio Code is used to run the commands for the tasks and project. 

* In your GitHub account, create a GitHub repository. GitHub have a short guide on how to [create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories)

When you are finished working in the codespaces, it is important to disconnect the codespace as it will continue running until it times out due to inactivity. Charges could be incurred unless it is disconnected. Closing the browser tab does not stop the codespace.
