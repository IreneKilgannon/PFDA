# Programming for Data Analytics 

Author: Irene Kilgannon

Student ID: G00220627

This is my repository for the module, Programming for Data Analytics for a [Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) at [Atlantic Technological University](https://www.atu.ie/).

The repository contains three directories:

    * PFDA-mywork
    * PFDA-assignments
    * PFDA-project

## PFDA-mywork

This PFDA-mywork directory contains the lab work that is associated with the weekly lectures.

## PFDA-assignments

The assignments directory will contain a mixture of small practical assignments and a mini project.

Five assignments were set. These assignments were:

- Assignment 1
    - Create a repository for the module. 
    - [My repository](https://github.com/IreneKilgannon/PFDA)

- assignment2-weather.ipynb
    - Using a csv file in the assignment folder in the [PFDA-courseware repository]((https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/PFDA-courseware)) create a nice plot of the temperature over time.
    - Use the 'dryBulbTemperature_Celsius' column

- assignment03-pie.ipynb
    - A nice pie chart of peoples email domains in the csv file at the [url](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download).

- assignment_5_risk.py
    - The program that simulates 1000 individual battle rounds in Risk (3 attacker vs 2 defender) and plots the result.
    - For extra marks: a more complicated version that simulates a full series of rounds for armies of arbitrary sizes, until one side is wiped out and plots the results.

- assignment_6_Weather.ipynb
    - Using the data from this link, https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv
    - Plot:
        The temperature
        The mean temperature each day
        The mean temperature for each month
        The Wind speed
        The rolling windspeed (say over 24 hours)
        The max windspeed for each day
        The monthly mean of the daily max wind speeds

## PFDA-project

The project directory will contain a large project.
