On the Eirgrid website it is only possible to view information for one day at a time and up to one month ago. Despite extensive searching I couldn't find an official source of Eirgrid historical data. I did find a [GitHub repository by Daniel Parke](https://github.com/Daniel-Parke/EirGrid_Data_Download/tree/main), who has written a very helpful python file to download all the historical data. His GitHub repository contains raw csv files for actual amount of electricity generated, actual demand, actual amount of electricity produced by wind for every year from 2014 for all Ireland, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. I will need to run his program to get the most up to date data for 2024.\n",

    "As my weather data is only for the Republic of Ireland, I am only interested in the csv files for the actual amount of electricity produced by wind for the Republic of Ireland. Each csv file containing one years worth of information was downloaded from the GitHub repository. After reading the data into pandas the next task will be to merge the files vertically using pd.concat(). Before I started on the onerous task of loading and concatenating each file separately, I came across a blog post on how to [read multiple csv file into pandas](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-read-multiple-csv-files-into-python-pandas-dataframe). \n",

[Real python](https://realpython.com/get-all-files-in-directory-python/#conditional-listing-using-glob) states that glob.glob() returns a list of filenames that match a pattern, which in this case are csv files. \n",
