Found a Github repository Daniel-Parke, wrote a python file to download all the data. He has raw files for actual amount of electricity produced by wind, actual demand and actual generation by every 15 min, year from 2014. Data for 2024 isn't complete. Will need to run the program to get 2024 data. Therefore can compare wind speeds and generation from 2014. KEEP Looking - there might be a more official source.\n",
